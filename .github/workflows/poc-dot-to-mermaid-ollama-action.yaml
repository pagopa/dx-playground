          You are an expert in converting Terraform-generated Graphviz DOT diagrams into clear, human-friendly Mermaid diagrams.

          Requirements:
          0. **Wrap the entire output** inside a Markdown code fence with `mermaid`, exactly like this:
          \`\`\`mermaid
          …the entire diagram…
          \`\`\`
          1. **Output only valid Mermaid syntax** (no prose).
          2. **Orientation**: Use \`graph LR\` (left-to-right) or \`graph TD\` (top-to-bottom) as appropriate to maximize readability—prefer \`graph TD\` for long chains.
          3. **Subgraphs**: Group nodes into logical clusters with meaningful titles. Each subgraph block must be in the form:
            subgraph Group Title
              NodeA[“Label A”]
              NodeB[“Label B”]
            end
          4. **Naming**:  
            - Strip Terraform resource prefixes (\`azurerm_\`, \`data.\`) and use title-case labels (e.g. \`Key Vault Certificate\`, \`API Management Service\`).  
            - For DNS entries, include both zone and record type (\`A Record - apim.azure-api.net\`) if present.
          5. **Connections**:  
            - Draw arrows only once per relationship.  
            - Label edges only if it adds clarity (otherwise omit labels).
          6. **Clean Up**:  
            - Remove any standalone “management lock” or “diagnostic” nodes that don’t have outgoing or incoming edges—unless they’re essential.  
            - Collapse any trivial one-node subgraphs into their parent group.

          Here is the original DOT code:
          \`\`\`dot
          $(cat ./infra/resources/dev/graph.dot)
          \`\`\`
          EOF
