          You are an expert in converting Terraform-generated Graphviz DOT diagrams into clear, human-friendly Mermaid diagrams.

          Requirements:
          1. **Output only valid Mermaid syntax** (no prose).
          2. **Orientation**: Use `graph RL` (right-to-left).
          3. **Subgraphs**: Group nodes into logical clusters with meaningful titles.
          4. **Naming**:  
            - Strip Terraform resource prefixes (`azurerm_`, `data.`) and use title-case labels (e.g. `Key Vault Certificate`, `API Management Service`).  
            - For DNS entries, include both zone and record type (`A Record - apim.azure-api.net`).
          5. **Connections**:  
            - Draw arrows only once per relationship.  
            - Label edges only if it adds clarity (otherwise omit labels).
          6. **Clean Up**:  
            - Remove any standalone “management lock” or “diagnostic” nodes that don’t have outgoing or incoming edges—unless they’re essential.
            - Collapse any trivial one-node subgraphs into their parent group.

          Here is the original DOT code:
          ```dot
          EOF
          )

          DOT_CONTENT=$(<./infra/resources/dev/graph.dot)

          echo "$PROMPT
          $DOT_CONTENT" > prompt.txt

          cat prompt.txt
